## How to Run the Code

Follow these steps to run the project and generate your own submission file:

### 1. Setup (Already done by Manus AI)

All necessary files have been organized into the `titanic_survival_prediction` directory. The raw data files (`train.csv`, `test.csv`, `gender_submission.csv`) have been placed in the `data/` directory.

### 2. Install Dependencies (Already done by Manus AI)

Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. If not, you can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib
```

### 3. Advanced Data Preprocessing

Navigate to the `src` directory and run the advanced preprocessing script. This will clean the raw data, engineer new features, and create `train_advanced.csv` and `test_advanced.csv` in the `data` directory.

```bash
cd titanic_survival_prediction/src
python3 advanced_preprocess.py
```

### 4. Train Ensemble Model

After preprocessing, run the ensemble model training script. This will train multiple machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, SVM) and save them in the `models` directory.

```bash
cd titanic_survival_prediction/src
python3 ensemble_model.py
```

### 5. Generate Submission File

Finally, run the prediction script to generate the `submission.csv` file in the root of the `titanic_survival_prediction` directory. This file uses the trained ensemble model to make predictions and can then be submitted to the Kaggle competition.

```bash
cd titanic_survival_prediction/src
python3 predict_and_submit.py
```

## Next Steps

- You can now submit the generated `submission.csv` file to the Kaggle Titanic competition.
- To further improve the model\"s accuracy, you can explore:
    - More sophisticated feature engineering techniques.
    - Different ensemble methods (e.g., stacking).
    - Advanced hyperparameter tuning for each individual model.
    - Cross-validation strategies.
